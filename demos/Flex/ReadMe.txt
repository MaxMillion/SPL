The Flex demos need to have the SPL SWC or source code added before compiling. Please read the SPL Quick Start guide in the docs directory for more information.

All of the demos will need to have access to a word list file to function properly. See the code of individual demos to adjust this.

Please note that the demos have not been tested or refined to the same level as the SPL library, and are not officially supported. However, if you encounter any difficulties with them, please let us know, and we will be happy to help.

To open the Flex demos, please create a new project in the folder, with the same name as the application.
